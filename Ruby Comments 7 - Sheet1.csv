" Mark Cruz And since you started the personal attacks, I could not help but say, you are a selfish person for thinking you are special enough for some god to rescue you while sending the typhoon to the people living in the ""north"". You really think your ""god"" favors you over some random person living in Bicol?

" Keith Orville Gahob Okay to clarify.. Why did i say about its direction towards the north? The possibility of it hitting Manila is one of the scariest thing... Although every scenario is scary, but Metro Manila has really bad drainage and flooding problems. Which means more people will be affected..and Im not from manila... Like i said, ALL OF US, I HOPE WE WILL ALL BE SAFE.

" Mark Cruz I know you said that but if you read your entire statement it said ""Jesus never fails"", after saying the typhoon is moving north. With that, it is obvious that you are thanking Jesus sending Ruby north and sparing your place. ""All of us"" can mean all t...See More

" Mark Cruz Another topic: By saying ""Jesus never fails"" you are implying that jesus has control over the typhoon. What happens when someone die from the typhoon? Why not stop it? Did Jesus just abandon the person to die? What did the hypothetical typhoon victim do to deserve a horrible death? Does jesus play favorites?

"Keith Orville Gahob Ahh that.. Does Jesus play favorites? Absolutely NOT... Like i said, you have to know the character of Jesus. Its a long explaination but if you want to really know the answers and not just being a hypocrite, then you should read ""The Desire of Ages"" author is Ellen White. that book explains everything you need to know who Jesus was, who He is and who He will be. Or, you can simply read the Bible.

" Keith Orville Gahob You can download EGW Writings from the Google playstore and download the book The Desire of Ages. If you think that is a waste of time then stop asking questions and throw slinging accusations about Jesus whom you don't know.
