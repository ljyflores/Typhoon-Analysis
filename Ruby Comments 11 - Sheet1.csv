"Glenn Mark Madon MY OFFICIAL MESSAGE BEFORE THE INVASION OF SUPERTYPHOON RUBY ENTERS OUR MOTHERLAND. To my fellow countrymen, today, we will face another odds which will again test how strong we are as Filipinos. As another life threatening events roars beyond our seashores, as this grim reality lurking behind our airspace is now approaching that would brings us again into heartbreaking, heatwrenching, bloodlusting tormentious memories, we will not fall back. We have been already to many situations  this before which tried to break down our souls and move our faith by this chaotic catastrophies. But, this will not break us. We shall prevail! We will stand strong, stay firm and we will fly above all together. Though this storms of life will crush us, thought this wave of life will make us fall
, thought it's whipping wind of sorrow tries to shake us, we will soar high!. To the Republic of the Philippines, to the brave souls of the Armed Forces, to the comforting hands of the local units and all the Councils which gave all thier sacrifices, our grateful thanks to all of you.! 
WE WILL PREVAIL. WE WILL STAND TOGETHER. WE WILL RISE FROM THE ASH OF THIS DESTRUCTION. AND AFTER THIS, WE WILL SEE THE SUN SMILE IN US ALL TOGETHER. MAY GOD BLESS US, and GOD SPEED  ·
